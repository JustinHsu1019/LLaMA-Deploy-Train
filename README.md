# LLaMA Deployment & Training Playground

1. This repository contains the presentation slides, scripts, and documentation from a training session held on September 7, 2023. 
2. The session was aimed at the Information Development Department of ChainSea and strategic partners at Anhui Yitongtianxia. 
3. The material is designed for a two-hour training session focused on the LLaMA-2 model training and a demonstration of fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 7B model using the corporate data from Anhui Yitongtianxia.

## Training Session Overview

### Topic:
LLaMA-2 Model Training and Fine-tuning Demonstration with LLaMA-2 7B Model

### Date:
September 7, 2023 (Thursday) Afternoon

### Audience:
Colleagues from ChainSea Information Development Department and technical peers from Anhui Yitongtianxia.

### Objective:
To provide a practical overview and hands-on experience with large language models, specifically focusing on the LLaMA-2 model's training and fine-tuning processes. Participants will learn about the underlying techniques, best practices, and detailed steps to tailor the LLaMA-2 7B model to specific organizational needs using Anhui Yitongtianxia corporate information datasets.
